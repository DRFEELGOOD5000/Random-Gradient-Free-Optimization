# Random-Gradient-Free-Optimization
Here is a report, presentation, and sample code on random gradient free optimization. I used the following paper to develop all the materials in this repository: Nesterov, Y., Spokoiny, V. Random Gradient-Free Minimization of Convex Functions. Found Comput Math 17, 527â€“566 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10208-015-9296-2
